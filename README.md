2026 World Cup Pool (Polla Mundialista) 🇨🇴

This is a web application created to run the pool (sweepstakes) for the 2026 World Cup in the USA, Mexico, and Canada.

How It Works
The project is built using pure HTML and JavaScript (no weird frameworks used).
It uses a free, cloud-based **Supabase** database to store predictions.

Steps to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser (Chrome, Edge, whatever works).
2. Enter your name.
3. Fill in the scores for Groups A through L.
4. **ATTENTION:** In the knockout stage, if you predict a draw, you **must** mark the checkbox for who wins in penalties.
5. Finally, choose the Champion, Runner-up, Third Place, and Top Goal-Scoring Team.
6. Hit the yellow **SAVE MY POOL** button.

Scoring Rules
- Exact Score: **5 points**
- Correct Winner or Draw (non-exact score): **2 points**

Special Final Points
- Correct **CHAMPION**: **13 points**
- Correct **RUNNER-UP**: **10 points**
- Correct **THIRD PLACE**: **6 points**
- Correct **Top Goal-Scoring Team**: **8 points**
